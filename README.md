# Plant-Disease-Detector
Developed a plant health detection system using images, achieving 85% accuracy in detecting plant diseases  for image pre-processing and Scikit-learn for ML model predictions.
Processed over 5,000 images to train the model, enhancing its reliability and robustness in various plant health
scenarios.
 Utilized Matplotlib for result visualization, providing clear and actionable insights that improved diagnosis
efficiency by 30%.
